						    <br />
						    The withdrawal date will be the day the Registrar receives  and signs the completed official form from the student ,or in the case of an  unofficial withdrawal, the date the of student&rsquo;s last class attendance.&nbsp; This date will be used to determine the  amount of the refund of tuition according to the following schedules: </span>

                          <span class="style2">RETURN OF TITLE IV  FUNDS POLICY</span><br />
						    <br />
						    <span class="style3">The law specifies how your school must determine the amount  of Title IV program assistance that you can earn if you withdraw from  school.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Title IV programs covered by this law  include Federal Pell Grants, Academic Competitive Grants, SEOG Grants, Federal  Stafford Loans, and Federal&nbsp; PLUS  Loans.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
						    <br />
						    When you withdraw during your payment period, the amount of  Title IV program assistance that you have earned up to that point is determined  by a specific formula.&nbsp; If you received (or  your school or parent received on your behalf) less assistance than the amount  you earned, you may be able to receive those additional funds.&nbsp; If you received more assistance than you  earned, the excess funds must be returned by the school and/or you.<br />
						    <br />
						    The amount of assistance that you have earned is determined  on a prorata basis.&nbsp; For example, if you  completed 30% of your payment period of enrollment, you earn 30% of the  assistance you were originally scheduled to receive.&nbsp; Once you have completed more than 60% percent  of the payment period, you earn all the assistance that you were scheduled to  receive for that period.<br />
						    If you did not receive all of the funds that you earned, you  may be due a post-withdrawal disbursement.&nbsp;  If your post-withdrawal disbursement includes loan funds, your school  must get your permission before it can disburse them.&nbsp; You may choose to decline some or all of the  loan funds so that you don&rsquo;t incur additional debt.&nbsp; Your school may automatically use all or a  portion of your post-withdrawal disbursement of grant funds for tuition, fees,  and room and board charges (as contracted with the school).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school needs your permission to use the  post-withdrawal grant disbursement for all other school charges.&nbsp; If you do not give your permission (some  schools ask for this when you enroll), you will be offered the funds.&nbsp; However, it may be in your best interest to  allow the school to keep the funds to reduce your debt at the school.<br />
						    <br />
						    There are some federal financial aid funds that you were  scheduled to receive that cannot be disbursed to you once you withdraw because  of other eligibility requirements.&nbsp; For  example, if you are a first-time, first-year undergraduate student and you have  not completed the first 30 days of your program before you withdraw, you will  not receive any FFEL loan funds that you would have received had you remained  enrolled past the 30th day.<br />
						    <br />
						    If you receive (or your school or parent &nbsp;receives on your behalf) excess Title IV  program funds that must be returned, your school must return a portion of the  excess equal to the lesser of:
						    </p>
						    </span>
						    <ol start="1" type="1" class="style3">
                            <li>&nbsp;your institutional charges multiplied by       the unearned percentage of your funds, or</li>
						    <li>the entire amount of       excess funds.</li>
						    </ol>
						  <p><span class="style3">The school must return this amount even if it didn&rsquo;t keep  this amount of your Title IV program funds.<br />
						      <br />
						      If your school is not required to return all of the excess  funds, you must return the remaining amount.&nbsp;  Any loan funds that you must return, you (or your parent for a PLUS  Loan) must repay in accordance with the terms of the promissory note.&nbsp; That is, you make scheduled payments to the  holder of the loan over a period of time.<br />
						      <br />
						      Any amount of unearned grant funds that you must return is  called an overpayment.&nbsp; The maximum  amount of a grant overpayment that you must repay is half of the grant funds  you received or were scheduled to receive.&nbsp;  You must make arrangements with your school or the Department of  Education to return the unearned grant funds.<br />
						      <br />
						      The requirements for Title IV program funds when you  withdraw are separate from any refund policy that your school may have.&nbsp; Therefore, you may still owe funds to the  school to cover unpaid institutional charges.&nbsp;  Your school may also charge you for any Title IV program funds that the  school was required to return.&nbsp; <br />
						      <br />
						      Withdrawal date for Title IV purposes is defined as the date  the student began the institution&rsquo;s withdrawal process, the student&rsquo;s last date  of recorded attendance, or the midpoint of the semester for a student who  leaves without notifying the institution if the last date of attendance cannot  be established.<br />
                          </span>
  <strong><br />
  <span class="style4">Return of Title IV Funds Policy for AIM Students</span></strong><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style3">The Department of Education has established a policy determining how Title IV Funds (Pell Grants, SEOG, Stafford Loans) are to be handled for programs offered in modules (such as the Adults in Ministry Program) when a student receiving any of those funds ceases to be enrolled prior to the end of a term.  What is considered a “module”?  For A.A.S. students, a module is an 11-week period in which two courses are normally taken.  For B.S. students, a module is a 5-week course.<br />
 					   <br />
  					   The number of hours you enroll for each semester establishes your initial enrollment for the semester.  Your Pell Grant is based on that enrollment status.  However, if you later drop classes that you never begin attending, your Pell Grant must be revised to the lower enrollment status.    Student loans are contingent upon a student being enrolled at least half time (6 hours) a semester.  If you enroll and later drop classes that you have never begun so that your enrollment status falls below 6 hours, you technically are not eligible for a student loan that semester.  If a loan disbursement was made before you dropped below half time, that disbursement can remain.  However, subsequent disbursements must be cancelled.<br />
                       <br />
                       For financial aid purposes, a student who stops attending (or officially withdraws) at any point in the AIM semester is considered to have withdrawn, even if one or more classes have been completed with a passing grade.  In other words, a student is considered to have withdrawn if he does not complete all days scheduled to complete within the semester.  (This is a <u>new regulation</u>; previously if a student completed one course with a passing grade and then dropped subsequent courses, it was not deemed to be a withdrawal).  If the student provides the Registrar with written confirmation that he/she will return in a subsequent module, as long as the return date is within 45 days of the date attendance ceased, it is not considered a withdrawal.  Similarly, if a student is enrolled simultaneously in two courses within an 11-week module and stops attending only one of those, it is not considered a withdrawal.<br />
                       <br />
                       If a student officially drops classes that he has never begun attending before his withdrawal, those classes are not counted in the “days scheduled to complete.”  The school must document completion of all courses with a passing grade.  If there is no passing grade in the last scheduled course, the school must demonstrate the student completed the period  by showing he was in attendance through the entire period.<br />
                       <br />
                       The following questions and examples may help clarify this:<br />
                       <br />
                       <ol>
                         <li>Did the student cease to attend before completing or fail to begin attendance in a course scheduled to attend?<br /><br />
                           <em>If yes, go to question 2.  If no, it is not a withdrawal.</em></li><br />
                         <li>When ceased to attend or failed to begin attendance in an enrolled course, was the student attending other courses?<br /><br />
                           <em>If yes, it is not a withdrawal. If no, go to question 3.</em></li><br />
                         <li>Did student confirm in writing attendance in a later module in the term?<br /><br />
                           <em>If no, student is a withdrawal.  If yes, it is not a withdrawal if attendance is resumed in the later module.</em></li>
