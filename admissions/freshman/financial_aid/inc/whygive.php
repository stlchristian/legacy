    <td><h3>Why Give to SLCC? </h3>
        <p>Since 1956, Saint Louis Christian College has been equipping men and women for Christian ministry. To provide a high-quality Christian education is expensive, and the college has relied on gifts from individuals, churches, businesses, and foundations to keep this education affordable for those who desire to serve in full-time Christian service.</p>
        <p>Now that SLCC has begun the free tuition program to all full-time, residential students, your gifts are even more important. Your gifts help ensure that students will have access to an outstanding, high-quality Christian education. They will be able to prepare for a lifetime of service in vocational, Christian ministry without incurring a large educational debt which could restrict their options for ministry.</p>
        <p>Through the SLCC website, you can make a one-time cash donation or set up a recurring donation cycle (monthly, quarterly, etc.). For larger gifts (of $250 or more), we recommend mailing them directly to the college so the 3% processing fee does not significantly reduce the amount of your gift.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your support of Saint Louis Christian College!</p>
        <ol>
          <ul>
            <li>You help equip men and women as leaders to impact the world for Christ.</li>
            <li>You help keep Bible college education affordable so graduates don&rsquo;t go into ministry with a large student loan.</li>
            <li>Your church may benefit from an SLCC graduate on the staff or lay leaders who are SLCC alumni.</li>
